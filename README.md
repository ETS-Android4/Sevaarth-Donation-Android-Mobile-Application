# Sevaarth-Donation-Android-Mobile-Application

### Problem Statement
<p align = "justify">
To build a platform that will bridge the gap between donors and organizations. Application will serve the purpose for donating daily-need items like Food, Clothes, Books, etc and other crucial items like Blood, Medicines
as well. So, the main purpose is to connect trusted users without any intermediary service. With the advancement in technology, the internet-based mobile application will act as a bridge between the donors and the donation recipients. The people who are willing to donate (Food, Clothes,
Money, Medicines, Blood, etc.) can register through the application. The charity organization can also register and put up their requests for the required items.<br/>
<b> The main idea lies that the user can find the nearest needy organisation by choosing the category of items they want to donate. This will help the organisations to receive the donation items which they need. </b> <br/>

#### Overview: <br/>
1. The users can create an account based on their role, i.e., Donation Recipients and Donors. There will be no role of any third party here. The users have to register
themselves by entering the basic details. <br/>
2. For The Donors, there will be an option to donate and categories to select the type of donation, i.e., food, clothes, books, etc, and also an option to select the preferred
location of the organization.<br/>
3. After selecting the category, they will have a list of the organizations that need those things among them from which they can select whom they wish to donate. <br/>
4. They have to enter some details like their name, the details of items i.e. food, clothes, books, money, medicines, blood (in a pint) , and also an option to upload the image of
the item. Donation reports will be sent to respected organizations via email.<br/>
5. On the Receiver's side, i.e.NGOs, there will be an option to check the donatorâ€™s details, location, and quantity based on category and enter the particular requirement from the
categories which they need. Verification of NGOs will be done by admins. <br/>
